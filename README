This is a refactor of Pyevolve. 
Current goals are:

* new-style classes
* PEP8
* general refactoring of classes/functions to increase modularity
* implement a genome delegating some operations to a "gene class", incapsulating initialization, mutation logic and providing simple means of using such genome as argument representation in order to optimize complex functions.
    
  
It's a work in progress, and in this early stage I don't recommend using this.

The name of this project could probably change in the near future, as this fork is divergig a lot from the original source.
